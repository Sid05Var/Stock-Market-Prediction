# Stock-Market-Prediction

The stock market is a dynamic and complex financial arena where individuals and
organizations can trade shares of publicly listed companies. It serves as a platform for
companies to raise funds for expansion and innovation, while also providing opportunities for
investors to grow their wealth. The Seminar focuses on using a type of neural network called
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock prices. The stock market is known for its
complexity and volatility, which makes accurate predictions a challenging task. However,
LSTM networks have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-term patterns in
sequential data, making them suitable for modeling time series data like stock prices.
In this Seminar, historical stock price data is collected and prepared for input into the LSTM
model. The LSTM architecture is then built, consisting of multiple LSTM layers followed by
a dense output layer. Dropout regularization is applied to prevent the model from overfitting
the training data and to enhance its generalization capability. The constructed LSTM model is
trained using the historical stock price data, and its performance is evaluated using separate test
data that the model has not seen before. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and
accuracy are used to measure the model's predictive ability. The experimental results
demonstrate that the LSTM model is effective in predicting stock prices. The model achieves
promising accuracy and demonstrates its ability to identify patterns and trends in the stock
market data. These findings contribute to the existing research on using deep learning
techniques, like LSTM, for forecasting financial time series.
